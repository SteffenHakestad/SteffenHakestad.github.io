        <h1>FAQ</h1>

        <p>Frequently asked questions about our solutions.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-container">
        <h3 class="blue-text">Q: Traditional cyclonic separators can be prone to internal erosion issues, how does the DDS™ compare?</h3>
        <p>A: There is no comparison. There are no internal nozzles/liners which eliminates the traditional erosion potential.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-container">
        <h3 class="blue-text">Q: There is a drive towards fully autonomous / remotely operated equipment, is this a possibility?</h3>
        <p>A: Yes, the DDS™ has semi-auto and full-auto modes with options for remote operation of the equipment depending on application and location. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-container">
        <h3 class="blue-text">Q: Efficient data processing is essential to our well production team, what can you provide?</h3>
        <p>A: Real-time data and trends such as separated solids (by weight) can be sent directly from the wellsite to your production team.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-container">
        <h3 class="blue-text">Q: Separation of sand > 100 Micron is expected, what about sand < 100 Micron?</h3>
        <p>A: We guarantee 90% + separation efficiency of sand down to 50 Microns which reduces the need for additional sand filtration. Why not bench test the DDS™ against your traditional solutions.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-container">
        <h3 class="blue-text">Q: What is the main benefit of the impeller?</h3>
        <p>A: The impeller introduces highly stabilized and significant centrifugal forces to the separation process, independent to variable energy behaviour of the well flow.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-container">
        <h3 class="blue-text">Q: What is the speed of the impeller?</h3>
        <p>A: The impeller speed is variable and can be conditionally tuned to optimise separation efficiency.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-container">
        <h3 class="blue-text">Q: Is there a pressure drop in the separation chamber?</h3>
        <p>A: There is no pressure drop, nor any pressure increase.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-container">
        <h3 class="blue-text">Q: What is the solids separation capacity per hour, for one unit?</h3>
        <p>A: Normative range is 400 - 600 Kgs / 900 - 1350 lbs per hour, with capability to accommodate 800 Kgs / 1800 lbs per hour during peak solids.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-container">
        <h3 class="blue-text">Q: Is it possible to maintain the well flow when flushing collected solids?</h3>
        <p>A: Yes, the patented design of the separation and collection chambers allows for continuous well flow at all times.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-container">
        <h3 class="blue-text">Q: How long does it take to empty the collection chamber?</h3>
        <p>A: The process is fully autonomous and takes 1 – 2 minutes to complete.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-container">
        <h3 class="blue-text">Q: Can your system accept flow and solids from multiple wells?</h3>
        <p>A: Yes, and where needed two or more DDS™ units can be seamlessly coupled together to accommodate high capacity multi-well projects.</p>
